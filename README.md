Currently has breadth first search and capability to generate random maze; more to come soon.

## Instructions
* Click on a node once to make it a start node (green)
* Click on a node twice (or once if node is already a start node) to make it an end node (magenta).
* Hold 'w' and drag mouse to generate wall nodes, or click on "Generate Maze" to create a random maze.
* Click "Reset" to clear the grid.
